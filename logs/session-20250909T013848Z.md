## Summary
- Established modular MCP-native tool suite: story-goal-mcp (authority), kanban-mcp (standalone multi-board), eventlet-mcp (reusable events), retrospective-mcp (protocol facilitator).
- Scaffolded kanban-mcp repo with SQLite, default columns, MCP tools, and demo script.
- Designed multi-tenant support via user_key/board_key; optional file-based sync disabled by default.
- Planned reusable event bus and listener tools; agreed to integrate next.
- Retrospective protocol captured; to be implemented as separate MCP.

## Next Steps
- Implement eventlet-mcp and integrate with kanban-mcp (emit + register/list/remove/test).
- Validate kanban-mcp with demo and log a note via story-goal-mcp.
- Scaffold retrospective-mcp with your protocol tools and exports.
